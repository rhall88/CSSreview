    <p>My name is Ryan Hallgarth.  After high school I joined the U.S. Army
    as a Multimedia Illustrator.  I deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan as a Combat Photographer.  After my deployments
    I worked at the Pentagon for three years.  I exited the military to pursue higher education.  I'm currently
    working in the Computer Information Technology Web Development degree path.</p>
